# Biblical Hebrew Learning Platform

A **Duolingo-style web application** designed to teach **Biblical Hebrew** in a structured, accessible, and beginner-friendly way.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to bring a **Duolingo-like learning experience** to the study of **Biblical Hebrew**.

While there are many tools available for learning **modern Hebrew**, learners who wish to study **Biblical Hebrew**—particularly for understanding the Old Testament in its original language—are far less well supported. Existing resources are often fragmented, academic, or difficult to approach without prior language experience.

This project aims to fill that gap.

## Vision

This platform is intended to serve as a **launching point** for students of Biblical Hebrew by:

- Teaching the **basics of Biblical Hebrew** in a clear, structured progression
- Emphasizing **foundational grammar, vocabulary, and reading skills**
- Providing an experience that is **interactive, guided, and approachable**
- Equipping learners with the **tools they need to continue their studies independently**

Rather than replacing advanced or academic study, the goal is to **prepare learners** so they can confidently move on to deeper textual and theological exploration.
